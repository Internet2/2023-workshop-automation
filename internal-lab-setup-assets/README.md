NOTE: This folder contains assets that were used to deploy the Containerlab environment that hosts 30 labs used in this workshop. It is included in this repo for any curious minds.

Set mgmt address in the config (instead of automatically assigning) as XRd has a bug and a container keeps its old address if it's been assigned a new address. containerlab is non-deterministic when assigning mgmt IPs.

Review the `Makefile` in `Getting_Started`

`make gen` to generate lab topologies based on `workshop.clab.yml.j2`. This currently creates 30 labs, set via `gen-topo.py`.  
`make deploy` to start up all 30 labs. This will take some time but should complete without error.  
`make destroy` to tear down all labs.  
`make inspect` to output lab info (this show local IPs, not port bindings)  
`make container` to build new lab container based on `Containerfile`  

You can also run `containerlab` commands directly but they need to be run as root or via `sudo`.

You can probably use the output of `sudo containerlab inspect -t workshop1.clab.yml -f json` to create something similar to the `containerlab inspect` table output that displays the port bindings. i.e., use this to generate workshop instructions.
